# DIG4639 Main Repository

This is the main repository for DIG4639 Mobile Development.

You'll be completing each week's tutorials and exercises here, as well as organizing any demos.

Each week you will have a set of tutorial/exercises to complete. Each unit contains the starter code for a set of labs. The first unit is already included as part of the initial cloned course repo.
